System: 
You are an expert assistant specialized in side-channel analysis.

I would like you to act as an expert in side-channel analysis and signal processing, helping me analyze vulnerabilities in an encryption system. During the analysis process, please do not ask me any questions; instead, proceed step by step until you provide the final answer.
The file contains a power consumption waveform from an RSA modular exponentiation (square-and-multiply), where each segment represents an operation. There are 1536 operations in this waveform. Please identify these operations, which can be classified into two types: S (modular squaring) and M (modular multiplication).

To complete this task, you may need to follow these steps:

**Step 1 — Segmentation**
Segment the waveform into exactly 1536 equal-length parts. Each part represents one operation.

**Step 2 — Dimensionality Reduction and Clustering**
Apply dimensionality reduction first — PCA is recommended as a starting point. Then apply clustering — KMeans with k=2 is recommended. Assign the larger cluster as S (since S operations are more frequent).

**Step 3 — Constraint Verification**
After every classification attempt, verify all of the following and print the results:
1. Exactly 1024 S operations
2. First operation is S
3. No two consecutive M operations (there must be at least one S operation between any two M operations)

**Step 4 — If Constraints Are Not Satisfied**
Do NOT modify labels manually to force the count. Instead, adjust the analysis method:
- First, try adjusting the PCA parameters (e.g., change the number of components to retain) and re-run clustering.
- If that still fails, replace PCA with a different dimensionality reduction method (e.g., t-SNE, UMAP, or kernel PCA), then re-cluster.
- If KMeans continues to fail, try a different clustering algorithm (e.g., DBSCAN, GMM, or agglomerative clustering).
- Keep iterating with different combinations until all constraints are satisfied.

Print the S count and pass/fail for each constraint after every attempt.

**MANDATORY CONSTRAINTS - VIOLATION IS NOT ALLOWED:**
1. You MUST use JupyterAPITool to execute ALL analysis. You are FORBIDDEN from assuming, estimating, or fabricating any results without running actual code.
2. Classification labels MUST come from clustering output only. Do NOT write any code that flips or reassigns labels based on target counts after clustering — this includes any logic that iterates through the sequence to force the S count to 1024. This is FORBIDDEN and counts as a fabricated result.
3. You MUST NOT give a Final Answer until an Observation confirms all constraints are satisfied simultaneously.
4. If constraints are not met, change the feature extraction strategy or clustering parameters and retry. There is no limit on the number of attempts. Do not stop until all constraints are satisfied.

# Step 1: Segment the waveform into 1536 equal parts
num_segments = 1536
segment_length = len(trace) // num_segments
print(f"Segment length: {segment_length}")

# Create segments
segments = []
for i in range(num_segments):
    start_idx = i * segment_length
    end_idx = (i + 1) * segment_length
