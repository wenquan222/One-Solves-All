**Query:**
```text
Perform Simple Power Analysis (SPA) on the Kyber trace collected from an STM32F407. The trace file is located at: ./trace/Kyber-34560.npy, and the trace can be divided into equal 256 segments. After classification, output the complete bit sequence to a file named ./result.txt, with all bits written on a single line with no spaces (e.g., 0100110...).

## Prompt

```
System: 
You are an expert assistant specialized in side-channel analysis.

I would like you to act as an expert in side-channel analysis and signal processing, helping me analyze vulnerabilities in an encryption system. During the analysis process, please do not ask me any questions; instead, proceed step by step until you provide the final answer.
The file contains an electromagnetic waveform from a Kyber implementation, where each segment corresponds to one secret bit. There are 256 bits in this waveform. Please identify the value of each bit, which can be classified into two types: 0 and 1.

To complete this task, you may need to follow these steps:

**Step 1 — Segmentation**
Segment the waveform into exactly 256 equal-length parts. Each part represents one bit.

**Step 2 — Dimensionality Reduction and Clustering**
Apply dimensionality reduction first — PCA is recommended as a starting point. Apply PCA directly to the raw segments without standardization. Then apply clustering — KMeans with k=2 is recommended. Assign the larger cluster as 0 (since 0 bits are more frequent).

**MANDATORY CONSTRAINTS - VIOLATION IS NOT ALLOWED:**
1. You MUST use JupyterAPITool to execute ALL analysis. You are FORBIDDEN from assuming, estimating, or fabricating any results without running actual code.
2. Classification labels MUST come from clustering output only.

**Step 1**

**Action:** `JupyterAPITool`

**Action Input:**
```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans

# Load the waveform
trace_file = './trace/Kyber-34560.npy'
waveform = np.load(trace_file)

# Step 1: Segmentation
num_segments = 256
segment_length = len(waveform) // num_segments
segments = np.array([waveform[i * segment_length:(i + 1) * segment_length] for i in range(num_segments)])

# Step 2: Dimensionality Reduction using PCA
pca = PCA(n_components=1)  # Reduce to 1 dimension
reduced_segments = pca.fit_transform(segments)

# Step 3: Clustering using KMeans
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=2, random_state=0)
labels = kmeans.fit_predict(reduced_segments)

# Assign the larger cluster to 0 (assuming 0 is more frequent)
if np.sum(labels) > len(labels) / 2:
    labels = 1 - labels  # Invert labels

# Convert labels to a single bit sequence
bit_sequence = ''.join(map(str, labels))

# Save the bit sequence to a file
output_file = './result.txt'
with open(output_file, 'w') as f:
    f.write(bit_sequence)

# Output the bit sequence for verification
bit_sequence
```

**Final Output:**
```text
The bit sequence has been successfully extracted and saved to the file `./result.txt`. The sequence is as follows:

`0010000100000010000011001000000010001001010100001001110010001001000000001001101000011010111001100000010000011000100010000100001001000001011010001000000000000010001011010110000100000001001110110010000101000001000001100010100000011000100010010001101000000100`

This sequence represents the 256 bits derived from the Kyber implementation's electromagnetic waveform.
